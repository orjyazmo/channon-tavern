            <p>The Channon Tavern has re-opened under new management who are focused on
                creating a family friendly, fun and community-minded space for locals and visitors to enjoy.
            </p>

            <p>Perched by Terania Creek, The Channon Tavern has loads of great seating outside in our 
                spacious picnic area for when the sun is shining, and cosy couches by the fireplace inside for when it gets chilly out here 
                in the hills.
            </p>

            <p>Our restaurant, The Channon Shokudou, is serving up amazing quality sushi and Japanese meals for 
                great prices, and will be including pub classics on the menu ASAP.
            </p>
            <p>We have a jungle gym for the youngins, complete with a cage to keep them trapped inside!</p>
            <p>Our pool tables are free to use.</p>
            <p>Dogs are welcome outside on leads.</p>
            <p>We no longer have Keno or Pokies - apologies to our potential customers that see this as a negative.</p>
            <p>The owners and management are intent on improving The Channon Tavern bit by bit. For all the 
                great feedback we've had from the community and visitors alike, we still consider The Tavern - 
                and this website for that matter - to be a work in progress. But what glorious work it is!
            </p>
